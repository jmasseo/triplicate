# triplicate
triplicate - a falling object game based on 'Arcade'
entry by jmasseo#8228

the idea here is that i have three minigames here which are all essentially the same game, hence three of a kind.
My original motif was 'filing forms in triplicate' then i just sort of went from there.

My only dependency is arcade and python3.
to install, pip install -r requirements.txt
or alternatively:  pip install arcade
to run:
python3 main.py


Got some trees from here

The space ships are made by vesselforge and published to OGA.

I don't remember where the trash can and forms came from.
the poop is an emoji.
